CDH comes with an integrated framework that enables testing the inbuilt matching configuration. It is a handy feature to track changes to the matching configuration. The test framework acts like a blackbox: A pairwise comparison of incoming records takes place to yield one of the results a) the records are certain matches, b) the records are possible matches and c) the records do not match.
